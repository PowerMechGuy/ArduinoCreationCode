# ArduinoCreationCode
This repository will contain all the code solutions for various projects that I will build.

1. InfraredStepperMillis
This program basically allows me to control multiple stepper motors
and an LED with an IR sensor. This program is significant because it
successfully uses the millis feature of the arduino without sacrificing
speed. It used the halfstep feature of the stepper motor libarary to
reach maximum speeds. There is still a feedback error due to the 
inefficient use of the infrared data collection variables. Nevertheless,
the code is fully functional and runs a 2 wheeled robot with minimal
difficulty.
Status: Success - needs refinement
